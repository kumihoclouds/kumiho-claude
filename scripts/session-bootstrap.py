"""SessionStart hook — inject memory skill invocation instruction.

This hook fires at the beginning of every session (Claude Code or
Cowork) and injects additionalContext that tells Claude to invoke the
kumiho-memory skill before responding to the user.  Without this hook
the skill's SKILL.md content is never loaded into context and the
memory bootstrap cannot run.

The context also reminds Claude about the recall-before-respond rule
so it persists across the full session.
